# Pancakes Stacking Program
Pancakes is an application to extract end-diastolic frames from ultrasound images for the purpose of ECG-gated arterial diameter analysis. Pancakes searches for peaks of the QRS complex, pulls frames from the video, and recomplies them into one 'stacked' DICOM file for import into automated edge-tracking software.

Pancakes is currently compatible with GE B-Mode images with the default ECG strip location at the bottom of the screen, but is easily modifiable to suit different types of images.
